=== Modules
CarCV consists of several modules:

* *carcv-core* -- core detection and recognition module
* *carcv-cpp* -- an old and deprecated implementation of this project in C++ with heavy use of OpenCV
* *carcv-webapp* -- a Java EE web-app implementation of the CarCV Core

CarCV uses http://semver.org/[semantic versioning] and a branching model similar to http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/[this].
