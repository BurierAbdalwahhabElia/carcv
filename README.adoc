== Modules

CarCV consists of several modules:

* *carcv-core* -- CarCV Core
* *carcv-cpp* -- CarCV CPP is an old and deprecated implementation of this project in C++ with heavy use of OpenCV
* *carcv-webapp* -- CarCV WebApp is an example implementation of CarCV Core

== Configuring the project with the m2eclipse plugin

The m2eclipse plugin is a plugin in Eclipse for Maven.
This is the new way (and compatible with tycho).

* Open Eclipse
* Follow http://m2eclipse.sonatype.org/[the installation instructions of m2eclipse].
** Follow the link *Installing m2eclipse* at the bottom.
* Click menu *File*, menu item *Import*, tree item *Maven*, tree item *Existing Maven Projects*.
* Click button *Browse*, select a repository directory. For example `~/git/carcv`.

For more information, see http://www.sonatype.com/books/m2eclipse-book/reference/[the m2eclipse book]

== Configuring the project with the deprecated maven-eclipse-plugin

[WARNING]
====
Note: This way of configuring the project is old and deprecated.
Please read the section
link:#configuring-the-project-with-the-m2eclipse-plugin[Configuring the project with the m2eclipse plugin]
above.
====

The maven-eclipse-plugin plugin is a plugin in Maven for Eclipse.
This is the old way (of which the development has stopped).

Run this command to generate `.project` and `.classpath` files: 

`mvn eclipse:eclipse`

* Open Eclipse
* Menu item *Import existing projects*, navigate to the project base directory, select all the projects (= modules) it lists.

[NOTE]
====
`mvn eclipse:eclipse` does not work for our eclipse plugins because it is not compatible with tycho
(and never will be).
====
