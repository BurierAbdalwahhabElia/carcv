= Using carcv-core

== Using the default implementation of CarRecognizer

To use +carcv-core+ (number plate detection and speed detection) in your application,
simply instantiate a +FileCarRecognizer+ (the default implementation of +CarRecognizer+).

For example, in +carcv-webapp+ we use this method in +RecognizerBean+ like this:

[source,java]
----
@Stateless
public class RecognizerBean {
    private FileCarRecognizer recognizer = new FileCarRecognizer(Pat inputDirectory, Path outputDirectory);

    public void recognize() throws IOException {
        recognizer.recognize();
    }

}
----

This assumes you use a data input and output directory in a filesystem +java.nio+ can access.

== Using your own implementation of CarRecognizer

If you wish to implement it yourself, simply extend the +CarRecognizer+ abstract class.
Notes on implementation details are in the javadoc for +CarRecognizer+. 
To see the default implementation, see the +org.carcv.impl+ packages.
