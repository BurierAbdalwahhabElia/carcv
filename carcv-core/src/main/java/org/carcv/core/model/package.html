Provides basic archetypes and model entities.
<p>
There are two basic archetypes: {@link org.carcv.core.model.AbstractModel} and {@link org.carcv.core.model.AbstractEmbeddable}.
<p>
AbstractModel is an abstraction for all JPA {@link javax.persistence.Entity}-s,
AbstractEmbeddable is an abstraction of all JPA {@link javax.persistence.Embeddable}s.
All other objects are derived from one of these two.
