Provides basic archetypes and model entities.
<p>
There are two basic archetypes: {@link AbstractModel} and {@link AbstractEmbeddable}.
<p>
AbstractModel is an abstraction for all JPA {@link @Entity}-s,
AbstractEmbeddable is an abstraction of all JPA {@link @Embeddable}s.
All other objects are derived from one of these two.
