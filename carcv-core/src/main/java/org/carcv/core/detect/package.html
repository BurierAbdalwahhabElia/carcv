Provides an abstraction of basic detection objects.
All Detectors implement the {@link Detector} interface.
<p>
These are three types of objects used for the three stages of detection:
<ol>
<li>Sorting of video frames into real cars -- {@link CarSorter}
<li>Detection of {@link NumberPlate}s -- {@link NumberPlateDetector} 
<li>Detection of car {@link Speed} -- {@link SpeedDetector}
</ol>
