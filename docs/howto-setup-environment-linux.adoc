=== How-to setup your build environment on Linux & Mac

==== Build-related installations

. *Install Git*
** Fedora: `sudo yum install git`
** Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install git`

. *Install Java8 JDK* -- link:http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html[Oracle JDK Downloads] -- Select: Java Platform (JDK)

. *Install Maven* -- preferably the latest version you can.
Usually, your distribution's package management repository is enough:
** Fedora: `sudo yum install mvn`
** Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install maven`

. *Run the build* (see the Building section in the link:../README.adoc[README])

. If you plan to *contribute code*, please set-up https://github.com/oskopek/ide-config[IDE coding templates] first

==== Running integration tests

If you want to run integration tests as part of your build, follow these instructions:

. *Install an application server* -- You need to install at least one Java EE application server.

.. It is recommended to install the latest http://wildfly.org/[Wildfly] release.

.. You should place it into `/opt/wildfly/yourWildflyVersionHere`
and create a symlink called `/opt/wildfly/latest` to point to it.

... `ln -s /opt/wildfly/wildfly-8.0.0.Final /opt/wildfly/latest`

... Sometimes, *if you can't place Wildfly into /opt*, you want to place the environment variable *JBOSS_HOME* into your *.bashrc* file:
`export JBOSS_HOME=/path/to/wildfly`. In this case, make sure to run the profile `wildfly-it-travis` instead of `wildfly-it`

. *Add a security domain and data source* to `standalone.xml`, see: link:webapp/howto-jboss-standalone-xml.adoc[How-to JBoss standalone.xml]

. For specific instructions on deploying the app to OpenShift, see: link:webapp/deploy-to-openshift.adoc[Deploy to Openshift]

. *Create a directory for data input/output* -- the default is `$HOME/dev/java/carcv_data/in` and `$HOME/dev/java/carcv_data/out`.
